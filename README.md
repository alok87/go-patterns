# Design Patterns for Go

Design patterns in Go.

Motive is to keep the examples as close to real world problems as possible. Suggestions and reviews are welcome.

## Categorization:
- Creational: Concerns with the process of object creation.
- Structural: Deals with composition of objects.
- Behavioural: Ways in which objects interact and distribute responsibility.

### Creational
- [Abstract Factory](./creational/abstract_factory.go)
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Solitare
- Builder

### Structural
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Decorator
- ObjectPool/Flyweight
- Proxy
- Glue
- Composite

### Behavioural

- Template Method
- Chain Of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Interpretor
- Iterator
- Walker

## Contributing

Aim is to explain the benefit of the pattern with a simple real world example. Do create issues and pull requests to make it better.
